This folder contain the codes developed while studying and practicing for the Programming Marathon's Study Group, a study group of [PET Computação UFC](https://github.com/petcompufc).

Maybe some day I will commit some new things to this repo. If I do, it will probably be just some new challenges solutions developed for fun and skills improvement.
